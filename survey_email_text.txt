The quality of research software is vital for scientific research in the
Nordics and beyond.
To ensure that the software development meets the needs
of the Nordic research community, we would like to learn more about
those of you who write this software and how to better support you.
Whether you develop software for research in an academic, government,
non-profit or commercial environment - full-time or part-time -
we would like to hear from you.

Nordic RSE (Research Software Engineers), as part
of International RSE network, is pleased to invite you
to participate in this 5 minutes survey on Nordic Research Software.

We do not collect any personally identifiable information.
To be informed about the results of this survey and other
items of interest to research software developers,
