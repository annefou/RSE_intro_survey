Research within many diverse scientific domains is dependent on research software 
used to generate scientific results through statistical analysis, simulation and modeling.
To understand better the various environments in which software development takes 
place in Nordic research communities and what can be done to support them, 
the Nordic RSE (Research Software Engineer) group would like to learn more about 
the people who write software as part of their work.

We are part of an International RSE network and want to bring the benefits of RSE community
engagement to the Nordics. As a first step along this path, we are pleased to invite you
to participate in this short 5 minute survey on the situation of Nordic research software development.
Whether you develop software for research in an academic, government,
non-profit or commercial environment - full-time or part-time -
we would like to hear from you.

We do not collect any personally identifiable information.
To be informed about the results of this survey and other
items of interest to research software developers,
